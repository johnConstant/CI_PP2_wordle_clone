        <h1>What is wordle?</h1>
        <p>Wordle is the simple online game that's taken the world by storm. Here's how to play Wordle and much more</p>
        <h2>What's different?</h2>
        <p>In this version, you select the number of letters in the word you are guessing. In the classic version you only get to play once a day, in this version you can choose how many words you want per game. And with different difficulty levels you can increase or decrase the number of guesses you get per round.</p>
        <h2>Rules:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have the right letter in the right spot, it shows up green</li>
            <li>A correct letter in the wrong spot shows up yellow</li>
            <li>A letter that isn't in the word in any spot shows up gray</li>
            <li>Letters can be used more than once</li>
            <li>Figure out the correct word before you run out of guesses</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
        <p>If you're a word game purist, you may want to avoid the following tips and rely entirely on your own instincts. For everyone else who's sick of seeing gray boxes, here are some tips that you may find helpful.</p>
        <p><strong>Choosing your first word:</strong> The first word is arguably the most important. To maximize the value of your opening gambit, choose a word with three vowels and five different letters. Some examples: orate, media, radio. I always use "adieu" for some reason. It's a habit and I'm refusing to break it.</p>
        <p><strong>Avoid reusing grays:</strong> Avoid reusing letters that have come up gray. Yes, this sounds obvious. But it can take time and effort to think of five-letter words that don't use letters you've already tried. That effort will pay off.</p>
        <p><strong>Letters can appear twice:</strong> This complicates matters, especially when you're running out of letters to try on word four or five. But letters often recur, as with words like chill, sissy and ferry having been the correct answers in the past. </p>
